# CARseq
Cell type Aware analysis for RNA-seq data

This is the R package for cell type aware analysis of RNA-seq data. The input are bulk RNA-seq data and cell type fraction estimates for a set of samples, and relevant variables of these samples, include a variable of interest for differential expression analysis as well as covariates.  


## Installation 
 To install this package in R, use 
 
 ```
    library("devtools");
    install_github("Sun-lab/CARseq")
